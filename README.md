I called this project Journal-ing. 

Simple layout / plan of the project before I started.

!["PlanLayout"](https://github.com/enukeWebDev/MERN_App/blob/main/frontend/asset/Plan:Layout.png?raw=true)

This is a simple application of M-E-R-N stack. I am working on becoming more familiar and comfortable with the M-E-R-N stack. It was my first time working on MongoDB and Redux. It was definitely a good learning experience!

When I was building the project, I leverage the use of different branch for each features. This saves me a TON of time as at one point - the app crashed. Because I used different branch, I was able to recover my project on it's working state! 

The app is a journal or something like a mini diary. 
  - If first time user - user MUST register
  - Each user is assigned with unique ID
  - User login (if registered user)
  - User can add events/notes and information will show up on the main dashboard
  - The information is persistent
  - User has the option to delete his/her own event
