I called this project Journal-ing. 

Simple layout / plan of the project before I started.

!["PlanLayout"](https://github.com/enukeWebDev/MERN_App/blob/main/frontend/asset/Plan:Layout.png?raw=true)

This is a simple application of M-E-R-N stack. I am working on becoming more familiar and comfortable with the M-E-R-N stack. It was my first time working on MongoDB and Redux. It was definitely a good learning experience!

What I Learned:
  - First time use of postman to test the routes I created
  - First time exposure to MongDB and Redux 
  - JWT (jason web token)
  - Run frontend & backend concurrently - npm run dev
  - More exposure to REST API's
  - Leverage the use of different branch (git/github) for each feature of the application 
  - Recover the branch on it's last working state - my project crashed at some point

The app is a journal or something like a mini diary. 
  - If first time user - user MUST register
  - Each user is assigned with unique ID
  - User login (if registered user)
  - User can add goals/task for the day, events/notes, good/not so good experience, reminders, etc
  - Information will show up on the main dashboard
  - The information is persistent
  - User has the option to delete his/her own event
