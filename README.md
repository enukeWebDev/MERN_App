I called this project Journal-ing. 

Simple layout / plan of the project before I started.

This is a simple application of M-E-R-N stack. I am working on becoming more familiar and comfortable with the M-E-R-N stack. It was my first time working on MongoDB and Redux. It was definitely a good learning experience!

When I was building the project, I leverage the use of different branch for each features. This saves me a TON of time as at one point - the app crashed. Because I used different branch, I was able to recover my project on it's working state! 



I'm currently learning REDUX.

This MERN Project is currently on-going...

- REST API has been completed 
- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) has been completed
- Complete the Register, Login and Logout Page
- Dashboard functionality is complete
- Next goal is to deploy
